## 2026-07-18 — fabric FULLY decoded from netlist; audits folded in

- **D08 fabric control/arbitration completely traced** from the extracted
  netlist (`.worktrees/kcma-d8-bmc-wiring/tmp/kgpe/kgpe.json`) → new doc
  `schematic-wiring/I2C-MUX-FABRIC-ARBITRATION.md`. Headlines:
  - QU9 enable = !SYS_PWRGD (automatic, no BMC GPIO); QU5 E# grounded
    (always on); U23 ownership = hardware mutex via D27/QQ9/QQ10
    (BMC owns iff BMC_PRESENT# low AND SB_BIOS_POST_COMPLT# low);
    only BMC-driven controls anywhere = GPIOF4/F5 selects; idle select = 11.
  - **Doc gap found & recorded:** the QU9-switched 4th segment reaches the
    TPM1 header (pins 13/14) and PCIe slots 1–5 SMBus (`I2C13*` nets) —
    §10 only mentioned the aux panel.
  - **LU1/LU2 (82574L) confirmed on +3V3_AUX** → D07 silicon testable host-off.
  - **U25 FRU EEPROM E2 pin strapped high** → address likely 0x54-0x57 (doc
    said 0x50-0x53); silicon i2cdetect to settle.
- **Audit agents (4) returned; corrections folded into TASKLIST:**
  - UNDERSTATED: modern U-Boot v2019.04 (`evb-ast2400_defconfig`) already
    boots→Linux→SSH in QEMU (CI `boot-uboot-ssh`); still zero board port.
  - OVERSTATED: FRU EEPROM "QEMU eeprom exists" — no DTS node/model wired
    anywhere → reset to ⬜.
  - D06 naming conflict: schematic says RTL8201**N** (U5); model/tests say
    RTL8201**CP** (PHYID 0x8201). Reconcile via silicon PHYID + datasheets.
  - F7-NCSI.md "not wired" verdict was MAC1-scoped — must be reconciled with
    schematic §7 (MAC2/RMII2 to LU1+LU2). QEMU MAC2 exists but unwired
    (`macs_mask=ASPEED_MAC0_ON`); DTS mac2 disabled; NET_NCSI not built.
  - Stale doc: `MODERN-KERNEL-STATUS.md` still lists the RMII-TX blocker
    superseded by the VIC + cur_speed fixes — needs updating.
  - "108 tests" = 67 test functions parametrized to 108 cases (accurate but
    now stated precisely).
  - Zephyr: confirmed zero code exists anywhere (D14 all-⬜ accurate).
- Push hiccups to GitHub (2 timeouts, then success) — network, not repo state;
  branch now synced at `2e10f8a`.

## 2026-07-18 — D03 BIOS-flash path SETTLED; D08 fabric facts gathered

- **D03/#8 settled by sub-agent research with schematic citations:** host BIOS
  flash `FU1` (W25Q16) is on the **SP5100 SPI controller** (`SB_SPI_*`, SU1
  D1/D2/G6/F3/F4/D6→FU1); BMC `AST_SPI*` nets reach only `BMC_FW1`; no shared
  node; AST2050 has no host-facing SPI master; BIOS fetch is FCH-SPI (not LPC
  cycles). Prior "no path" claim was RIGHT — now Ⓝ *with evidence* instead of
  assumption. TASKLIST updated.
- **D08 mux-fabric facts established (schematic):**
  - `AST_I2CS0` = GPIOF4 (ball W4), `AST_I2CS1` = GPIOF5 (ball W3) → U23[5]/[2].
  - `I2CMUX_ENABLE#` = inverted `SYS_PWRGD` (U8 74LVC14A: pin13 in = SYS_PWRGD
    per QU1_pins.md:315, pin12 out = I2CMUX_ENABLE#). So QU9 bridges I2C2↔I2C7
    **only while host power is good** — SPD unreachable with host off; QEMU
    model must enforce this.
  - U23 OE# nets (`N51800495`/`N51800497`) driver still untraced (BMC pinmap
    only shows U23[2]/[5]) — must come from the FZ netlist dumps; open item
    before silicon SPD access (multi-master hazard vs SP5100).
- Launched 4 read-only audit/research agents (statuses D01-D06, D07-D15 +
  U-Boot/Zephyr inventory, BIOS path [done ↑], NC-SI facts). 3 still running.

## 2026-07-18 — program start

- Merged `origin/main` (schematic-wiring PR #29) into `claude/bmc-functionality`
  → merge commit `a981389`, pushed.
  - **Mistake made & fixed:** a persisted `cd` caused the first merge attempt to
    land on the *local `main` checkout* (repo rule: never commit on main).
    Reset local main to `origin/main` (the stray commit contained only
    origin/main content — nothing lost), redid the merge in this worktree.
- Read `schematic-wiring/AST2050-BMC-WIRING.md` in full (597 lines).
- Created `TASKLIST.md`: 15 device blocks (D01–D15) × QEMU/U-Boot/Linux/Zephyr
  × validation environments, statuses seeded from prior program evidence.
- **REOPENED prior wrong claims** (schematic contradicts them):
  - NC-SI: RMII2 *is* wired to both 82574L NICs → D07.
  - DIMM SPD/TSOD: reachable via QU9/QU5/U23 fabric → D08.
  - SOL: UART1 → QU8 PI5C3257 → Super-I/O → D10.
  - Host-BIOS-flash path: to be settled from SP5100 doc, not assumed → D03.
- Next: commit program docs; audit pass over existing tree to firm up seeded
  statuses; then start execution with D08 mux fabric + D07 NC-SI (QEMU-first),
  per the QEMU-first faithfulness workflow.
